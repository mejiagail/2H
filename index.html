          <h2>Definition</h2>
          <p>he act, process, or occurrence of streaming data or of accessing data that is being streamed, according to
            <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/streaming">Merriam-Dictionary,
              Webster's</a> is known as "streaming." The phrase refers to the continuous transfer of audio and video
            files from a server to a client.
            In video streams, information is transmitted over the internet in a compressed form and is instantly viewed
            by the viewer. A constant
            stream of data is used to send the material, which is played as it comes in. Both live performance and
            recording are options.

          <p>Lifelabs is a subject that helps you learn more about something. Subjects like Information Literacy,
            Reflection, Presentation, and Problem-Solving Skills help us understand what a student really needs.
            LifeLabs also aids us as a student by helping us get more familiar with challenges and how to solve them as
            well as by teaching us extra coding skills that we did not anticipate learning. It also helped us improve
            our communication and collaboration skills. Although it was tough to accomplish, it really is rewarding when
            the output is completely finished! Despite the fact there are still difficulties happening, we are able to
            grasp and keep up. Without our teammates and LFs, Lifelabs wouldn't be this easy. This quarter, we’d like to
            express our gratitude to our group and LFs for teaching us a crucial life lesson.</p>

                  LifeLabs was a great help to me as a student because it taught me how to solve difficulties or problems that I encountered. I also gain new knowledge on Javascript, creating my own brand, sourcing information, and etc. It also improved my skills in collaborating with others and communicating with them as well.
